As a commonly used cathode material in lithium-ion batteries, spinel LiMn2O4 (LMO) suffers a significant decline in capacity during the cycling process due to pronounced Jahn-Teller distortion. To address this issue, we propose the application of c-axis compressive strain as a means to suppress the capacity decay. The results indicate that with the increase of the compressive strain, the Jahn-Teller distortion is still present but weakened a little bit. A maximum reduction of approximately 26 % in the Pugh Ratio is achieved, indicating an enhancement in the extensibility of LMO cathode, a reduced susceptibility of crack formation, and thereby increasing cycling stability. Moreover, compressive strain can also reduce the lithium-ion diffusion energy barrier, resulting in the improvement of electrochemical performance at high rates. In our study, under the strain of −3 %, a remarkable reduction of 18 % in the Li+ diffusion energy barrier is observed, as it decreases from 0.401 eV to 0.328 eV. The band gap (Eg) of LMO is also reduced with compressive strain, which improves the electronic conductivity. The present study is expected to reveal the effect of applying c-axis compressive strain on LMO cathode material, and trigger the practical strain engineering applications in regulating battery performance. 

1) Enhanced Ductility: compressive strain up to -4% reduces the brittleness of LiMn2O4. 

2) Boosted Ion Conductivity: strain lowers the Li+ diffusion barrier, enhancing battery rate performance.

3) Improved Electronic Properties: reduced bandgap due to strain increases electronic conductivity.
