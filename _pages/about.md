I am currently advancing my academic journey at the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. My research is under the dedicated supervision of **Prof**. [Xiaobing Luo](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/luoxiaobing/zh_CN/index.htm) and **Prof**. [Dongwei Xu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/XUDONGWEI/zh_CN/index/2071627/list/index.htm). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Energy and Environmental Systems Engineering degree from Nanjing Normal University, in 2022, under the nurturing guidance of **Prof**. [Chuanwen Zhao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B5%B5%E4%BC%A0%E6%96%87)

My research primarily focuses on **predicting superior lithium-ion battery materials using first principles, machine learning, molecular dynamics**, and other research methods. I explore the factors influencing the performance of lithium-ion batteries from the atomic and electronic structure perspective. Based on inorganic solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and aided by machine learning methods, I modify inorganic solid electrolytes at the nanoscale using methods such as **strain, doping, and vacancies** to further increase ionic conductivity. This involves modulating the rate of **lithium-ion diffusion, migration energy barriers, and energy band** of inorganic solid electrolytes, ultimately establishing a correlation between the microstructure and macroscopic properties. In addition, **I am also highly interested in the field of semiconductors** and am eager to make substantial contributions in this area through my dedication and hard work.

If you are interested in my projects or just having a nice chat, please feel free to email me (xzchensuper@gmail.com)! I am always happy to discuss with / learn from brilliant minds ^_^!

News

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
