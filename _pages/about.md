I am currently advancing my academic journey at the School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. My research is under the dedicated supervision of **Prof. [Xiaobing Luo](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/luoxiaobing/zh_CN/index.htm)** and **Prof. [Dongwei Xu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/XUDONGWEI/zh_CN/index/2071627/list/index.htm)**. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Energy and Environmental Systems Engineering degree from Nanjing Normal University, in 2022, under the nurturing guidance of **Prof. [Chuanwen Zhao](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%B5%B5%E4%BC%A0%E6%96%87)**

My research primarily focuses on **predicting superior lithium-ion battery materials using first principles, machine learning, molecular dynamics**, and other research methods. I explore the factors influencing the performance of lithium-ion batteries from the atomic and electronic structure perspective. Based on inorganic solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and aided by machine learning methods, I modify inorganic solid electrolytes at the nanoscale using methods such as **strain, doping, and vacancies** to further increase ionic conductivity. This involves modulating the rate of **lithium-ion diffusion, migration energy barriers, and energy band** of inorganic solid electrolytes, ultimately establishing a correlation between the microstructure and macroscopic properties. In addition, **I am also highly interested in the field of semiconductors** and am eager to make substantial contributions in this area through my dedication and hard work.

If you are interested in my projects or just having a nice chat, please feel free to email me (xzchensuper@gmail.com)! I am always happy to discuss with / learn from brilliant minds ^_^!
